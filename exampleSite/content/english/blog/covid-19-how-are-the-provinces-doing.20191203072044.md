I am eager to see if we are starting to see the end of the tunnel by provinces. Then I read somewhere that instead of plotting the number of daily new cases versus time, I can plot the number of new cases versus the number of cumulative cases in log-log plot. If we see a straight line, then it is still growing exponentially; however, if it bends down, we know we have hit the inflexion point.

The situation in Ontario and Quebec remain to be worrying, but there are signs that the pandemic has been slowing there for the past few days.

Nova Scotia, however, does not seem to hit the inflexion point yet, but the graph is too scattered for us to be sure.

The other heavily hit provinces, British Columbia and Alberta, have been seeing the curve flattening for some time.

Alberta, however, sees the last few points to resume the previous trajectory of the curve. That can be due to an expanded criterion of testing or statistical fluctuation in the graph.
