It was surprisingly nerve-wracking.

I went through a mock interview with a senior data analyst today. We have met before, so it was surprising for me that I was that nervous walking in. It was even an interview through Zoom, so I did not even have to leave my house.

An hour before my scheduled interview, I started reviewing terms I should know: precision, recall, f1 score, ROC, AUC... it's funny you thought you knew some terms, and then when you try to put them in words, you are drawing a blank. Panic was slowly building up in my mind.

Then there was the tech hiccup. Gosh, I hate technology.

Finally, I got through. We went through the interview. At the end she gave me a lot of useful feedback: you should explain with examples, you should be clearer at the beginning, you should think outside the limits of data science when answering this question...
