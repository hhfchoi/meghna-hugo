      and Physics at the University of Toronto.
  - name: Particle physics

    content: For my Ph.D. in experimental particle physics at the University of Victoria,
      I had to winnow out the signal events from a large dataset. Programming and
      plotting were a large part of my life then.

    content: 'Then I relocated to Hong Kong and worked as a medical physicist. But
      I did not stray far from data: most of my research projects were about analyzing
      data. Some of my projects are data fitting with various radiobiological models
      and analyzing the relation of data trends with machine performance.'

    content: In January 2020, I joined the full-time diploma program at BrainStation
      in Vancouver to train myself as a data scientist. I have fallen in love with
      coding and making plots all over again.
